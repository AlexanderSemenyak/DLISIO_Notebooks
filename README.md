# DLISIO_Notebooks
- Open source, public notebooks for working with DLISIO 
- Utilizing open data from the Volve field: https://data.equinor.com/dataset/Volve 
  - License: CC BY NC SA
- **DLISIO still in development** https://pypi.org/project/dlisio/ - this means that I will try and keep the notebook up to date with changes as they occur, but things will break, CI tests are implemented and if failing above, assume there has been a dlisio change!

# DLIS to LAS
- There is a notebook which is the beginnings of a Dlis to las file converter.
- Also wrote a function that could be used
- Definitely still needs a lot of testing, I could not get the resultant .las files to open in Petrel.
- Needs the functionality of manipulating the units on the index track - most depth-indexed .dlis are in 0.1 in.
