# DLISIO_Notebooks 
- Open source, public notebooks for working with DLISIO 
- Examples of the functionality in the dlisio package
- Utilizing open data from the Volve field: https://data.equinor.com/dataset/Volve 
  - License: CC BY NC SA
- **DLISIO still in development** https://pypi.org/project/dlisio/ - this means that I will try and keep the notebook up to date with changes as they occur, but things will break, please also read their Read The Docs https://dlisio.readthedocs.io/en/stable

# Current Status
- dlisio recently added lis parsing functionality.  I have just added a new notebook to demonstrate how to go from a .lis file to a dataframe, and to examine the .lis headers.
- Will continue to transform this into the coveted .lis to .las conversion!

# DLIS to LAS
- There is a notebook and a set of functions for a Dlis to las file converter.  Thanks for the help on this one!
