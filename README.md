# DLISIO_Notebooks
- Open source, public notebooks for working with DLISIO 
- Utilizing open data from the Volve field: https://data.equinor.com/dataset/Volve 
  - License: CC BY NC SA
- **DLISIO still in development** https://pypi.org/project/dlisio/ - this means that I will try and keep the notebook up to date with changes as they occur, but things will break.
